Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
&ldquo; &rsquo;Tis some visitor,&rdquo; I muttered,
&ldquo;tapping at my chamber door&mdash;<br>

Thrilled me&mdash;filled me with fantastic terrors never felt
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood
repeating<br>
&ldquo; &rsquo;Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;<br>
&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;or Madam, truly your
forgiveness I implore;<br>
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came

That I scarce was sure I heard you&rdquo;&mdash;here I opened
wide the door;&mdash;<br>
wondering, fearing,<br>
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no

But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber
&ldquo;Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,&rdquo; I said,

On the morrow <i>he</i> will leave me, as my Hopes have flown
&ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what it utters is its

so hideous. Blood was its Avatar and its seal&mdash;the redness
and the horror of blood. There were sharp pains, and sudden
dizziness, and then profuse bleeding at the pores, with

deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys. This was an
extensive and magnificent structure, the creation of the
prince&rsquo;s own eccentric yet august taste. A strong and lofty
having entered, brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the
abbey was amply provisioned. With such precautions the courtiers
might bid defiance to contagion. The external world could take
care of itself. In the meantime it was folly to grieve, or to
think. The prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure.
There were buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were
ballet-dancers, there were musicians, there was Beauty, there was
seclusion, and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad,

The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision
embraced but little more than one at a time. There was a sharp
turn at every twenty or thirty yards, and at each turn a novel
effect. To the right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall
pursued the windings of the suite. These windows were of stained
glass whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of
eastern extremity was hung, for example, in blue&mdash;and
vividly blue were its windows. The second chamber was purple in
its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple. The
white&mdash;the sixth with violet. The seventh apartment was
closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over
the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a
carpet of the same material and hue. But in this chamber only,
the color of the windows failed to correspond with the
decorations. The panes here were scarlet&mdash;a deep blood
color. Now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp
or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay
scattered to and fro or depended from the roof. There was no
light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite
of chambers. But in the corridors that followed the suite, there
stood, opposite to each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier
glaringly illumined the room. And thus were produced a multitude
of gaudy and fantastic appearances. But in the western or black
chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark
hangings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly in the
extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of
those who entered, that there were few of the company bold enough

and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous clang; and when the
minute-hand made the circuit of the face, and the hour was to be
stricken, there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound
which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical, but of
the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause,
momentarily, in their performance, to hearken to the sound; and
thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions; and there was
chimes of the clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest
grew pale, and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over
their brows as if in confused revery or meditation. But when the
echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the
assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at
their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each
to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce
in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty
minutes (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of
the Time that flies), there came yet another chiming of the
clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and
meditation as before.</p>
revel. The tastes of the duke were peculiar. He had a fine eye
for colors and effects. He disregarded the <i>decora</i> of mere
fashion. His plans were bold and fiery, and his conceptions
glowed with barbaric lustre. There are some who would have
thought him mad. His followers felt that he was not. It was
necessary to hear and see and touch him to be <i>sure</i> that he

taking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild music of the
orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps. And, anon, there
strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet.
And then, for a moment, all is still, and all is silent save the
voice of the clock. The dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand.
But the echoes of the chime die away&mdash;they have endured but
an instant&mdash;and a light, half-subdued laughter floats after
them as they depart. And now again the music swells, and the
dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking
from the tripods. But to the chamber which lies most westwardly
of the seven, there are now none of the maskers who venture; for
the night is waning away; and there flows a ruddier light through
appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet, there
comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly
emphatic than any which reaches <i>their</i> ears who indulge in

on, until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon

cessation of all things as before. But now there were twelve
strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it
happened, perhaps, that more of thought crept, with more of time,
And thus too, it happened, perhaps, that before the last echoes
of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence, there were many
individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of

disapprobation and surprise&mdash;then, finally, of terror, of
horror, and of disgust.</p>
well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited
such sensation. In truth the masquerade license of the night was
nearly unlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded

reckless which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with the

Prince Prospero as he uttered these words. They rang throughout
the seven rooms loudly and clearly, for the prince was a bold and
of pale courtiers by his side. At first, as he spoke, there was a
intruder, who, at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with
who put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed
within a yard of the prince&rsquo;s person; and, while the vast
assembly, as if with one impulse, shrank from the centres of the
rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the
the first, through the blue chamber to the purple&mdash;through
the purple to the green&mdash;through the green to the
orange&mdash;through this again to the white&mdash;and even
thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made to
arrest him. It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero,
maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice,
him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all. He
bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid
impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating
figure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the
velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer.
There was a sharp cry&mdash;and the dagger dropped gleaming upon
the sable carpet, upon which, instantly afterward, fell prostrate
the black apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall figure
stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock,

revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not

settled&mdash;but the very definitiveness with which it was
resolved, precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish, but
overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the
avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done

prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have
the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is

imposture upon the British and Austrian <i>millionaires</i>. In

in this manner. From the fourth the bones had been thrown down,
and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a
mound of some size. Within the wall thus exposed by the
displacing of the bones, we perceived a still interior recess, in
itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the
colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by

and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly
bewildered. A moment more and I had fettered him to the granite.
In its surface were two iron staples, distant from each other
about two feet, horizontally. From one of these depended a short
chain, from the other a padlock. Throwing the links about his
waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. He was
too much astounded to resist. Withdrawing the key I stepped back
from the recess.</p>

discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great
measure worn off. The earliest indication I had of this was a low
cry of a drunken man. There was then a long and obstinate
silence. I laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth;
and then I heard the furious vibrations of the chain. The noise
lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might hearken to
